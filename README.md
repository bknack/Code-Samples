These **Code Samples** include JavaScript, CSS and PHP. 

The PHP samples cover Drupal 6, Drupal 8 and PHP 7 -> 5.

_**Please note**_ that I have developed a consistant style in writing code. I use this style across languages and markup.

I'm aware that my style deviates from the Drupal standard. I would be happy to conform to that (or another) standard in lieu of my own.

In all cases, the files have been 'sanitized' to remove an 'proprietary' references since
all of these are actual production code.

    </ul>
  </li>

    PHP 7-5 contains a set of functions that make working with PDO simpler and allow all this code to be easily maintained.
    <ul>
      <li>
        dbFunctions.inc contains a comment at the top (Code Sample Notes:)
